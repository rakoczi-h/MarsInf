# MarsInf

Software for creating simulated models of the topography and density distributions of the crust and mantle of Mars, and for computing the gravitational field of these toy models. Finally, a parameter inference tool applying Normalising Flows is implemented for the inference of the parameters of the planet.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakoczi-h/MarsInf.git
cd MarsInf 
```

Two separate conda environments are required for creating planet simulations and for inference due to package conflicts.

Environment for planet simulations, containing octave-python interpreter:
```bash
conda env create -f octave_environment.yml
conda activate octave
conda env config vars set OCTAVE=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/octave-cli-8.4.0
conda env config vars set OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/octave-cli-8.4.0
```

Environment for inference, containing pytorch libraries:
```bash
conda env create -f flow_environment.yml
conda activate flow
```

The author acknowledges the use of the [_nflows_](https://github.com/uofgravity/nflows#citing-nflows) (C. Durkan et al. (2019)) package to construct implement the normalising flow elements and the [_glasflow_](https://github.com/uofgravity/glasflow) (Williams et al. (2023)) package to construct the neural network. The Matlab code used for planetary modelling belongs to Bart Root [_GSH_](https://github.com/bartroot/GSH) and was slightly altered to be suitable for usage with Octave.
